My website is designed to provide users with the ability to adopt a kitten. 
This will include a home page introducing users to the adoption program, a gallery page with an assortment of photos of the kittens, and a form page where they can apply.
Technologies include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Git/GitHub.
