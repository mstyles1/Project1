## My website is designed to provide users with the ability to apply for kitten adoption.

## This will include a home page introducing users to the adoption program, a profile page with bios for each kitten, and a form page where they can apply.

## Technologies include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Git/GitHub. 

## User stories:
- As a potential adopter, I want to view pet profiles so that I can find the cat that best fits my personality and lifestyle.
- As a potential adopter, I want to easily find the application page so that I can submit my application efficiently.
- As a potential adopter, I want to learn about the Cuddly Kitten Adoption Agencyâ€™s mission statement so that I can tr-ust them to be the best place to adopt a kitten.

## Future Improvements: 
- More testimonials or even a separate tab with testimonials. 
- More stylization on images ie: borders and other background elements to make them pop.
- More of a buffer at the bottom of each page.
